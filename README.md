# HM-Fraud-Analyst-Assessment


## Problem Statement
You are working for an online personal loans lending platform called “Joyful Dollars” as a lead fraud analyst. Your responsibilities include monitoring the fraud model performance and adjusting the fraud pass/review/reject trigger rules appropriately.

Currently, Joyful Dollars (JD) is facing a significant challenge. Over the past quarter, Joyful Dollars has experienced thousands of fraud attacks, leading to overly aggressive fraud review/reject rules. These stringent rules have resulted in relatively high false positive rates. Therefore, as the lead fraud analyst, you are responsible not only for monitoring model performance but also for proactively identifying trends, optimizing rule configurations, and recommending data-driven improvements. This involves analyzing historical data to pinpoint patterns and anomalies, visualizing key performance indicators, investigating specific rule triggers, and suggesting enhancements to the data collection process. 

Be sure to read the tips at the bottom of the page!

## Assignment:

You have been tasked with analyzing the available data to identify:
Given the data available, which dates are Joyful Dollars most likely to encounter spike(s) in fraud?
Create a graph outlining the percentage of Confirmed Fraud to False Positive based on Fraud Model Reason (fictitious example: vpn_review accounts for 50% Confirmed Fraud and 50% False positive) 
Which rule produces the highest number of false positives?
Build a model to replace the rule identified in question #3 using the model evaluation metrics below. (Hint: Focus on False positive and confirmed fraud population.)
Sample Model evaluation metrics: Recall, AUC-ROC, Accuracy 
You are welcome to provide any other performance metrics as you see fit
Are there any features or data points that are missing from this dataset that you would have liked to have?
